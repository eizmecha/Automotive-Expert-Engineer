## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Knowledge Engineering
The system covers **11 major automotive domains** and **82 diagnostic scenarios**, each structured with the following data model:

```json
{
    "question": "Natural-language diagnostic inquiry",
    "why_reason": "Technical justification",
    "symptoms": [...],
    "diagnosis_steps": [...],
    "solutions": [...],
    "recommendation": "Preventive advice",
    "emergency": true/false,
    "risk_level": "Emergency | High | Medium | Low",
    "dependencies": {
        "if_yes": [...],
        "if_no": [...]
    }
}
```

## Inference Mechanism

· Forward Chaining: Triggers diagnosis from presented symptoms
· Backward Chaining: Validates hypotheses based on answers
· Adaptive Questioning: Question flow tailored by user input
· Contextual Mapping: Inter-system dependencies handled intelligently
